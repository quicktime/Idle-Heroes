# Idle-Heroes

Idle-Heroes is a desktop application developed by Brendan Dolan using Javafx.

Idle Heroes is a mobile "gacha" game developed by IH Games. The Idle-Heroes project was developed as a personal min-maxing tool for Brendan Dolan and other players on his team.

The user updates their hero inventory on the Idle-Heroes application, and selects their current lineup of Heroes (6 heroes in a lineup). Heroes in the game have to follow a specific upgrade path, the Idle-Heroes application shows the upgrade path required for any hero, and based on the user-inputted hero inventory, indicates whether or not the hero can be upgraded currently.

The future goals for the project were to create a depth-first search of all heroes in the users inventory, and in real-time calculate the most efficient upgrade strategy. More common heroes should be used first in the upgrade strategy, and rarer heroes should either not be used at all, or should be used as a last effort strategy.
